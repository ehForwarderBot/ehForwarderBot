#: ../../guide/slave.rst:8
msgid "Although we suggest that slave channel should match with an IM platform, but you may try to model it for anything that can deliver information as messages, and has a limited list of end-points to deliver messages to and from as chats."

msgid "In most of the cases, slave channels should be identified as one single user from the IM platform, instead of a bot.  We suggest you to use a bot for slave channels only when"

#: ../../guide/slave.rst:47
msgid "Such features are accessed by the user in a CLI-like style. An \"additional feature\" method should only take one string parameter aside from ``self``, and wrap it with :meth:`~ehforwarderbot.utils.extra` decorator. The ``extra`` decorator takes 2 arguments: ``name`` -- a short name of the feature, and ``desc`` -- a description of the feature with its usage."

#: ../../guide/slave.rst:55
msgid "``desc`` should describe what the feature does and how to use it. It's more like the help text for an CLI program. Since method of invoking the feature depends on the implementation of the master channel, you should use ``\"{function_name}\"`` as its name in ``desc``, and master channel will replace it with respective name depend on their implementation."
